The code behind the [personal website of Jan Pöschko](https://poeschko.com).

Only the `.html`, `.png` and `.ico` files in this root directory need to be deployed to a live server. Other files (in the `dev` directory) were only needed during the development process, e.g. to create a data URL for the font which was ultimately inlined in [index.html](./index.html).

See the post [Making a super-fast simple website](https://medium.com/@poeschko/making-a-super-fast-simple-website-94788562b17a) for more background.
